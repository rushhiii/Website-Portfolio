            <summary style="font-size:large;font-weight: bold;">My Coding Journey</summary>
            <p>
                I still remember the first time I touched a computer with intention — it was in Grade 11. I signed up
                for a Computer Science course mostly out of curiosity, not knowing it would completely shift my future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back then, I didn’t even know how to type properly. I had never written a line of code, barely used a
                laptop, and had no idea what programming really meant. But something about solving logic problems,
                getting code to work, and seeing instant results on screen hooked me.
            </p>
            <p>
                That high school course turned into a passion. I started exploring Java, building tiny console apps, and
                experimenting with whatever I could. Over time, I moved into web development, learned JavaScript and
                Python, and started automating tasks just for fun. What started as a curiosity became my obsession — and
                now my career path.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University, working on
                personal projects, learning new technologies, and building tools that make life easier or more
                meaningful. I’m still learning, still growing — and still loving every moment of it.
